Created 2015/10/15
Updated 2016/12/28

  What is it?
  -----------

  On Rakuten (http://www.rakuten.co.jp/) there are a variety of ways to receive
  points on a daily basis. This program will attempt to automatically collect
  the points from various sources of the Rakuten ecosystem (Kuji, Infoseek mail,
  link clicking, etc).

  Please note that initial setup of your Rakuten user account is required, and
  in order to use some features some additional installations and files will be
  required on your machine. The requirements will be outlined in the
  "Requirements" section further down this document.

  Installation
  ------------

  From source, use Maven version >2.2.1 and the following command (you may also run the "install.sh" shell script):
  mvn clean install -P local assembly:single

  This will create a runnable jar in the root folder. To invoke:
  java -jar [binary_name].jar

  Documentation
  -------------

  The files to run the program with all its services are listed below:

  1. point_collector.jar : the runnable jar.
  2. log4j.xml : the logging config file. Tweak as you wish.
  3. kujiIdList.txt : a file containing the "Kuji ID" of lotteries that are
      "hidden" or otherwise not accessible from the main kuji page
      (kuji.rakuten.co.jp). To find the Kuji ID of a particular kuji, simply
      look at its URL:
      https://kuji.rakuten.co.jp/c6d1ddac64/...
      â†‘ the Kuji ID is "c6d1ddac64"
  4. Rwebsearch : For attaining 30 "tickets" on Rakuten Websearch. Follow the
      instructions in "Requirements" section for setup.
  5. log/ : a directory where logs will be recorded to. Can be configured in
      log4j.xml
  6. chromedriver[_LINUX|_OSX].exe : depending on OS, this binary needs to be put in the same directory as point_collector.jar.
  	  If you do not have chromedriver, download it from https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/chromedriver/downloads
      For Windows, keep the name as "chromedriver.exe"
      For MacOSX, rename to "chromedriverOSX.exe"
      For Linux, rename to "chromedriverLinux"
      **NOTE: For Chromedriver to work, Chrome web browser needs to be installed as well.

  Requirements
  -------------

  Rakuten has many services that you will need to "apply" for in order to start
  using. This program uses the following services:

  a. Kuji (lottery) (applying is NOT necessary)
  b. "Points by only clicking links": please check the following link
      http://www.rakuten-card.co.jp/service/pointclick/
  c. "Mail de Point": register using the following link
      https://member.pointmail.rakuten.co.jp/
      NOTE that near the bottom of registration there is option to set whether
      to receive mail from your personal mailbox or use the "browser inbox" that
      is provided for you.
      **Please choose the "browser inbox" option.**

  In order to execute the services listed above, the requirements are below:

  1. This software uses chromedriver as the Selenium WebDriver. Please download
  a copy suitable for your machine at the site below:
  https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/chromedriver/downloads

  2. Chrome browser must also be installed on your local machine. The directory
  of the installation must be a place where chromedriver is able to access it.

  3. Java 7 or above. Versions below 7 are not guaranteed to work.

  4. [OPTIONAL] for Rakuten WebSearch feature, in order to achieve maximum
  "points" for a single day, the Rakuten Websearch plugin for chrome must be
  setup for Chromedriver. If it is not, then the program will loop through all
  keywords but any searches past a certain number will not be counted (5 as of
  2015/10/15).

    For convenience, the plugin is attached with this repository. Depending on
    whether your machine is a MacOSX or Windows, rename either Rwebsearch_[OS]
    to just "Rwebsearch", making sure to replace existing directory. Ensure that
    Rwebsearch is placed in the same directory as the runnable jar file.
